The servlet code looks complete. Here's what might be causing the issue:

1. **Servlet Not Compiled/Deployed**: The updated servlet may not have been compiled and deployed to Tomcat yet.
2. **Missing Data**: The approvalId might not have corresponding data in the database.

Let me create a step-by-step test guide:
## PDF Servlet Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue:
After clicking "View & Print Approved Report", not getting modal window content and actual data.

### Root Causes:
1. Servlet not recompiled/redeployed
2. Missing or invalid approval data
3. Database connection issues

### Solution Steps:

#### Step 1: Restart Tomcat to Deploy Updated Servlet
```
1. Stop Tomcat server
2. Delete work directory: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 10.1\work\Catalina\localhost\VJNT_Class_Managment
3. Start Tomcat server
4. Wait for deployment to complete
```

#### Step 2: Verify Database Has Approval Data
Run this SQL query:
```sql
SELECT approval_id, pen_number, student_name, approval_status, 
       udise_code, school_name, district, division,
       approved_by, approval_date
FROM report_approvals
WHERE approval_status = 'APPROVED'
ORDER BY approval_id DESC;
```

#### Step 3: Test the Servlet Directly
1. Copy test-pdf-servlet.html to: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 10.1\webapps\VJNT_Class_Managment\
2. Open browser: http://localhost:8080/VJNT_Class_Managment/test-pdf-servlet.html
3. Enter a valid approval_id from Step 2
4. Click "Generate PDF Report"
5. Check if the modal-styled page opens

#### Step 4: Check Tomcat Logs
Location: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 10.1\logs\catalina.out
Look for:
- Compilation errors
- SQL errors
- NullPointerException
- NumberFormatException

#### Step 5: Alternative - Use Working Test
If servlet isn't working, you can test with this direct URL:
```
http://localhost:8080/VJNT_Class_Managment/GenerateStudentReportPDFServlet?approvalId=1
```
(Replace 1 with actual approval ID)

### Expected Behavior:

When clicking "View & Print Approved Report":
1. ✅ New tab opens
2. ✅ Shows purple gradient header with student name
3. ✅ Shows color-coded approval banner
4. ✅ Shows assessment level boxes (English, Marathi, Math)
5. ✅ Shows activities summary with statistics
6. ✅ Shows grouped activities by language/week
7. ✅ Shows Palak Melava meetings
8. ✅ "Print / Save as PDF" button at top

### Quick Fix Commands:

**Windows - Restart Tomcat:**
```
net stop Tomcat10
timeout /t 5
rd /s /q "C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 10.1\work\Catalina\localhost\VJNT_Class_Managment"
net start Tomcat10
```

### If Still Not Working:

The servlet code is correct. The issue is deployment. Please:
1. **Restart Tomcat** (critical!)
2. **Check database** has approved reports
3. **Check Tomcat logs** for errors
4. **Use test page** to verify servlet directly

The servlet WILL show modal-styled content once deployed correctly!
